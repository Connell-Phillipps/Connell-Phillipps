## Hi there, I'm Connell Phillipps 👋
### Manufacturing Engineer with a specialty in Data Science

As a manufacturing engineer, I was introduced to lean optimization, an approach to increasing efficiency that struck a chord with me. This ignited a passion for exploring system inefficiencies and solving optimization problems. Determined to deepen my impact I explored data science and equipped myself with the tools to analyze data and uncover hidden opportunities for optimization. By combining engineering and data science, I’m able to uncover inefficiencies, optimize processes, and contribute impactful, forward-thinking solutions in collaborative environments.

### Projects 🚀
- **Data Science & Predictive Modeling** | [NYC 911 Call Forecasting by Location](https://github.com/Connell-Phillipps/Capstone_911)
  - Using a time series forecast and data from NYC Open Data, I created a model that predicts and displays (heatmap) the number of 911 calls occurring within an hour at different locations across New York.
- **Data Analysis** | Part Matrix and Capacity Chart
  - Created a tool to capture machine capacities based on reported routings, facilitating segmentation of the shop into smaller part families. Integrated job financials into this tool, allowing efficient resource scheduling and supporting large-scale shop financial planning.
